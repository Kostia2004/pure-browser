.TH XULRUNNER\-STUB 1 "September 2, 2010"
.SH NAME
xulrunner\-stub - Generic binary to run xulrunner applications

.SH DESCRIPTION
xulrunner\-stub is not intended to be executed standalone. Doing so will only
trigger a "Could not read application.ini" message.

xulrunner\-stub is intended to be copied or symbolic-linked to a xulrunner
application directory, where an application.ini file lies. It is recommended
that the symbolic link is named after the application.

An application requiring a specific major version of the xulrunner runtime
(e.g. @GRE_VERSION@.*) should target the symbolic link at the corresponding
specific xulrunner\-stub (e.g. /usr/lib/xulrunner\-@GRE_VERSION@/xulrunner\-stub).

On the other hand, an application with a broad range of supported version
should target the symbolic link at /usr/bin/xulrunner\-stub.
