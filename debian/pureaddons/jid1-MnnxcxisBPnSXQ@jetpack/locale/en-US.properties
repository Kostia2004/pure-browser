slideshow_1 = Hi, I'm Privacy Badger! Thanks for installing me. I'm here to give you some helpful tips, so we can work together.
slideshow_2 = I will sit up here in your browser and watch for spying ads and trackers that are recording what you're doing online.
slideshow_3 = If I discover something that behaves like a tracker, I will put a stop to it by blocking it.
slideshow_4 = If you click on my icon you can see the list of potential trackers on the current tab.
slideshow_5 = If the slider is red, it means I have blocked that tracker entirely!  That fiend won't bother you any more.
slideshow_6 = If the slider is yellow, that means that I have partially blocked that tracker. I will do my best to prevent it from tracking you by eating its cookies, but blocking it entirely might break the page.
slideshow_7 = If the slider is green that means that I can't tell if this domain is tracking you yet. It might not be, but I will still keep an eye on it."
slideshow_8 = The first time you click my icon you might see that all the trackers are green—don't worry! I'm different from other tracker blocking software—instead of knowing a list of things to block right away, I learn what to block as you browse. If I'm not blocking anything yet, try browsing around to 4 or 5 different websites. I should start blocking common trackers after that.
slideshow_9 = I learn as I go, so the longer you use me the better I will get at protecting you from sneaky trackers!

slideshow_14 = If you want to change other settings, you can click this gear icon.
slideshow_15 = Of course you can also just leave all these settings alone, and I will continue to silently eat up all the trackers that I detect.
