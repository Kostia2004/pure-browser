xulrunner (1.9~rc2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Add a dependency on xulrunner-1.9 to
    xulrunner-1.9-gnome-support.
  * uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsOSHelperAppService.cpp: Properly catch test
    process exit code. This avoids mailcap entries where the test fails to be
    chosen.
  * toolkit/xre/nsAppRunner.cpp: Set DISPLAY with the value passed to
    --display. This avoids surprises when running DISPLAY=:0 iceweasel
    --display=:1, and some other problems.
  * toolkit/themes/gnomestripe/global/jar.mn: Install loading_16_grey.gif in
    classic.jar, and add an override to replace loading16.png, which happens
    to be an APNG file, with it. Closes: #487556.
  * toolkit/xre/nsAppRunner.cpp: Don't use static strings when setting
    environment, since there are situations where libxul.so gets dlclose()d,
    making these strings unavailable and leading to strange segfaults.
    Closes: #487785.
  * build/unix/run-mozilla.sh: Allow to debug with LD_PRELOADed libraries.
  * debian/rules, debian/postinstrm.in: Generate xulrunner-1.9.postinst from
    template, too. Also replace handling of upgrade by handling of
    abort-install.
  * debian/xulrunner-1.9.postinst: Removed.
  * debian/postinstrm.in:
    + Avoid xpcshell to use libjemalloc, avoiding install to hang while using
      libtrash or other LD_PRELOADed library conflicting with libjemalloc.
      Closes: #488349.
    + Catch xpcshell crashes in postinst/rm so that install can proceed
      properly. Remove possibly incomplete components registries it could
      have generated, then. Closes: #488350.
  * xpcom/glue/nsThreadUtils.cpp:
    + Tentatively fix crashes when epiphany exits.  This will require an
      epihany rebuild. Closes: #481925.
    + Also add a failsafe in NS_ProcessPendingEvents.

  * xulrunner/stub/nsXULStub.cpp: Refactored the previous change allowing
    xulrunner-stub to be symlinked, so that it works properly in more cases.
  * xpcom/io/nsAppFileLocationProvider.cpp: Add /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins as
    global location to find plugins.
  * configure, configure.in: Force to not use -fshort-wchar. Closes: #485876.
  * uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsOSHelperAppService.cpp: Avoid thread wait
    catching system() child process termination, which can make mailcap
    entries with tests ignored (since tests end up failing). Closes: #473557.
  * uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsOSHelperAppService.cpp: Ignore mailcap entries
    with "needsterminal". Closes: #467612.
  * toolkit/content/about.dtd, toolkit/content/about.xhtml,
    toolkit/content/jar.mn, toolkit/locales/en-US/chrome/global/about.dtd:
    Avoid the about: page to be broken when l10n chrome doesn't include the
    debian specific strings, which will stay in english.
  * modules/libpref/src/prefapi.*, modules/libpref/src/prefread.*: Allow .js
    preference files to set locked prefs with lockPref(). Closes: #469020.
  * toolkit/xre/nsXREDirProvider.cpp: Add another preferences directory for
    applications: preferences/syspref. It was existing in previous versions of
    iceweasel as a symlink to /etc/iceweasel/pref. This has the side effect to
    make these preferences there work again, and to disable the "set as
    default browser" dialog. Closes: #485662.
  * xulrunner/app/Makefile.in: Don't link xulrunner-bin against libjemalloc
    anymore.
  * build/unix/run-mozilla.sh, xulrunner/stub/Makefile.in,
    xulrunner/stub/nsXULStub.cpp: Load libjemalloc through LD_PRELOAD in both
    stub (which happened to not be linked against libjemalloc, so iceweasel
    should get a performance boost) and xulrunner-bin. This can be disabled
    by setting the MOZILLA_NO_JEMALLOC environment variable to some value.
  * debian/xulrunner-1.9.install: Don't install libjemalloc by default.
    Closes: #486663.
  * debian/rules: Refactored tests to use MOZILLA_NO_JEMALLOC, and install
    libjemalloc if the corresponding test succeeded.

    displaying (null) as common name at least on amd64, due to the way

  * security/manager/ssl/public/Makefile.in,
    security/manager/ssl/public/nsIBadCertListener.idl,

    instead of the new ssl alert pages from Firefox, which have several
    problems in embedding applications.

  * debian/control: Since we don't ship neither nspr nor nss so links, force
    dependencies onto versions of nspr and nss that ship them, to avoid
    partial upgrade surprises to our testing or unstable users.

    Fix unaligned word access. Thanks Martin Guy to have tracked this down.
    Closes: #483949.

  * New upstream Release Candidate release (taken from upstream CVS):
    + Avoid non null terminated strings being considered as such, leading to
      garbage at the end of drag&dropped content. Closes: #481021.
  * debian/control: Turn libmozjs-dev into an arch-dependent package, so that
    arch-dependent jsautocfg.h has the proper content on all architectures.
    Closes: #480045.
  * xpcom/reflect/xptcall/src/md/unix/xptcstubs_linux_m68k.cpp,
    xpcom/reflect/xptcall/src/md/unix/xptcstubs_mips.cpp: Add missing #include
    in xptcstubs on m68k and mips. This should finally settle the FTBFSes on
    these architectures. Closes: #479107.
  * debian/xulrunner-1.9.postinst: Remove test for 'upgrade', it is not a
    valid postinst argument.
  * debian/xulrunner-dev-bin.install, debian/rules: Install mozilla-config.h
    in arch-dependent xulrunner-dev-bin package.
  * debian/pyversions: Removed. It is actually useless in our case.
  * debian/rules:
    + Fix mozilla-js.pc to provide the proper include directory.
    + Add a test rule to try to detect xptc invoke/stubs breakages. An
      xpcshell script should be enough for that purpose.
    + Add -g to flags given to the assembler.
    + Make DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt actually work.
    + Use objdump -p instead of objdump -x.
    + Bumped shlibs for libmozjs1d. Also add option for dh_makeshlibs to fail
      when symbols file is not up-to-date.
  * debian/libmozjs1d.symbols: Add symbols file for libmozjs1d.
  * xpcom/reflect/xptcall/src/md/unix/Makefile.in, configure, configure.in:
    Add -fPIC to flags given to the assembler, and clean-up the Makefile.
    This will fix current xpcom brokenness on mips.
  * debian/control:
    + Added proper conflicts related to python-xpcom to xulrunner-1.9-dbg.
      Closes:#482471.
    + Build-Depend on libnspr4-dev >= 4.7.0 instead of wrong 3.7.0 (oops).
    + Build-Depend on libstartup-notification0-dev.
  * xpcom/build/nsXPComInit.cpp: Check for GRE_DIR/.autoreg to trigger
    components auto-registration, so that we can have independent application
    and xulrunner updates triggering it.
  * debian/xulrunner-1.9.postinst, debian/postinstrm.in: Don't remove .autoreg
    file, but create/refresh it.
  * config/rules.mk: Avoid to remove source .s files on make clean, which
    broke building again after make clean on architectures having .s source
    files.
  * xpcom/reflect/xptcall/src/md/unix/Makefile.in: Build xptcstubs with less
    optimizations on hppa to avoid g++ outsmarting the assembly code.
    Closes: #480905.
  * debian/configure.in: disable mochitest.
  * xulrunner/installer/Makefile.in, debian/rules: Revert previous change to
    build as if we were version 1.9 instead of 1.9bn, since milestone is now
    1.9.
  * debian/postinstrm.in, debian/rules, debian/xulrunner-1.9.install,
    debian/xulrunner-1.9.postinst: Don't ship regxpcom, as it is not supported
    upstream anymore, and generate components registry by a void call to
    xpcshell, which does the work.
  * debian/control: Build depends on xvfb, xfonts-base and xauth to be able to
    launch xulrunner tests.
  * debian/rules, debian/test: Implement a test application and run it during
    the test rule. Test both with and without libjemalloc, forcing memory
    allocation libraries with LD_PRELOAD to avoid relying on what is linked
    at build time, as it may change in the future. If we built against
    libjemalloc and the test fails, automatically rebuild without.
  * js/src/xpconnect/shell/xpcshell.cpp: Drop ancient code in xpcshell that
    ended up making error messages not being included.
  * debian/control, debian/rules: Insert carriage returns where lines are too
    long. This will improve diff readability in the future.
  * debian/mozconfig:
    + Enable url-classifier component ; it is needed by iceweasel.
    + Enable startup-notification.
  * debian/xulrunner-1.9.install: Don't put nsXULAppInstall.js component in
    the xulrunner-1.9 package.

    and javascript components, since we don't put any in another package.
  * debian/python-xpcom.install: Add new pyabout.py component.
  * docshell/base/nsAboutRedirector.cpp: Don't register about:about, which
    doesn't exist, and register about:, giving it permission to run chrome
    scripts.
  * xpfe/appshell/src/Makefile.in, xpfe/appshell/src/nsAppShellFactory.cpp:
    Remove nsAbout, from appshell, since we made nsAboutRedirector happily
    replace it.
  * debian/debAbout.js, debian/rules: Add a component to handle special
    about:debian, about:bugs and about:readme.debian urls.
  * modules/libjar/nsJAR.cpp: Apply suggestions from Christian Biesinger in
    bz#368428. The patch will eventually be applied upstream.
  * storage/src/mozStorageConnection.cpp,
    storage/test/unit/test_storage_connection.js: Apply patch from bz#421482
    to mitigate I/O issues with sqlite fsync()ing.
  * toolkit/content/Makefile.in, toolkit/content/about.xhtml,
    toolkit/content/jar.mn: Don't hardcode the XRE version number in the

xulrunner (1.9~b5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta release (taken from upstream CVS).
  * debian/mozconfig:
    + Don't enable native uconv. I'm tired of maintaining this broken piece
      of code (especially considering there are still know broken things).
    + Don't build with flat chrome. The original need for that was to allow to
      override content from other packages, but in the end this happened to be
      made possible with extensions and proper overlays.
  * debian/xulrunner-1.9-common.install:
    + Don't install ucnative.xpt, which is native uconv's xpt file.
    + Add new components files: nsBadCertHandler.js and exthelper.xpt.
  * intl/uconv/native/nsINativeUConvService.idl,
    intl/uconv/native/nsNativeUConvService.cpp,
    intl/uconv/src/charsetalias.properties,
    intl/uconv/src/nsCharsetConverterManager.cpp: Revert fixes to the native
    uconv.
  * debian/control:
    + Build-depend on zip for jar chrome. This has the side effect to make
      nsIPref.java removal from MozillaInterfaces-src.jar work.
    + Bump build dependency on libnss3-dev, since we require additions only
      available in latest version.
  * config/config.mk, config/make-jars.pl, configure.in: Revert changes to
    avoid needing zip when not required.
  * configure: Updated.
  * debian/xulrunner-1.9-gnome-support.install, debian/xulrunner-1.9.install:
    Moved libimgicon.so from xulrunner-1.9-gnome-support to xulrunner-1.9.
    This component doesn't require gnome, only standard gtk and glib.
  * memory/jemalloc/Makefile.in, toolkit/library/Makefile.in: Don't link
    libjemalloc statically into libxul, which has a potential of breaking
    embedding applications.
  * netwerk/cookie/src/Makefile.in: Don't turn warnings into errors.
    Closes: #474925. (Hoping it will not turn in a runtime failure)

    + MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH is not defined anymore: Closes: #441059.

    Also, fixed removal of files with names containing spaces.
  * debian/copyright: A whole lot of files have been either removed or
    relicensed under MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license. Some new external libraries
    have been incorporated into the source tree, too.
  * debian/mozconfig: Don't build crash reporter (Google Breakpad).
  * debian/mozconfig, debian/control: Use system sqlite and lcms.
  * configure.in: Don't check lcms version, for the same reason as libpng
    and others.

    XmlHTTPRequest works properly. bz#342133.

    1.9 instead of 1.9b4. Also fix permissions for /etc/gre.d file.
  * debian/control, debian/*: Change package names and installed files to fit
    new upstream.
  * debian/rules:
    + Adapted to new upstream files and install method. There is unfortunately
      only one install target now, and it must be run after build-jars when
      building binary-indep. This is why we must set .NOTPARALLEL.
    + Removed source target, which isn't appropriate anymore.
    + Changed the way we set optimization flags so that we use upstream ones,
      and arrange LDFLAGS so that -Wl,--as-needed appears before -lpthread
      during builds.
  * debian/mozconfig:
    + Don't set mozilla default home, it's not useful anymore.
    + Disable stripping of binaries during build.
  * debian/xulrunner.conf: Removed. The equivalent is now provided by upstream
    build system.
  * xulrunner/app/Makefile.in: Link libjemalloc to the xulrunner binary.
  * libxpcomglue0d.preinst, libxpcomglue0d.postrm: Divert libxpcomglue.so.0d
    from libxul0d so that both packages can be installed at the same time.

  * (was: debian/patches/99_configure.dpatch)
    configure: Updated.

xulrunner (1.8.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * The "upstream doesn't, so I do" release: Checked out the
    XULRUNNER_1_8_0_5_RELEASE tagged code from upstream CVS.

  * Fixes the following security vulnerabilities:
    CVE-2006-3113, CVE-2006-3677, CVE-2006-3801, CVE-2006-3802,
    CVE-2006-3803, CVE-2006-3805, CVE-2006-3806, CVE-2006-3807,
    CVE-2006-3808, CVE-2006-3809, CVE-2006-3810, CVE-2006-3811,
    CVE-2006-3812.

  * debian/patches/01_pyxpcom_deadcode.dpatch: Remove pyxpcom dead code and
    fix FTBFS on alpha this way. Closes: #381662.
  * debian/patches/01_nodataprotocolcontentpolicy_fix.dpatch: Fix from
    Firefox 1.5.0.6 to allow urls like mms:// in <object/>s
  * debian/patches/01_uname.dpatch: Use ${host_*} variables instead of
    uname in configure.in. Closes: #377418.
    This is a minimalist patch to solve the particular bad assembler choice
    issue. It would need a much greater work to actually do something totally
    clean, but the current patch should be enough for Linux builds.
  * debian/patches/00list: Updated accordingly.
  * debian/patches/99_configure.dpatch: Updated with autoconf.
  * debian/libxul-dev.install: Install files from SDK independently and don't
    install the jar files from sdk/lib, since they are in the
    libmozillainterfaces-java package.
  * debian/control: Fixed typo in libxul-common description.
  * debian/rules: Bumped shlibs for libmozjs as this version introduced 2
    new symbols.

    mipsel, where #274738 is fixed.
  * debian/patches/90_mips_performance.dpatch: Remove the xgot hack.
    Closes: #374389. Thanks Thiemo Seufer.
    Also remove the specific setting of MOZ_DEBUG_FLAGS="-g" for mips, it's
    built with -g anyways.
  * debian/rules:
    + Bump shlib for libmozjs0d because of a new symbol. Other libraries were
      not subject to symbol additions, so we can keep them as they are.

  * debian/patches/00_securityfix.dpatch: All security patches for the issues
    above. I hope none has been forgotten, it has been a real PITA to go
    through all the patches in upstream CVS to find those commits that *might*
    be related to fixing the flaws.

  * debian/patches/01_native_uconv.dpatch:
    + Add the scriptableunicodeconverter component. Will make chatzilla work.
    + Fix GBK and EUC-TW charset names so that iconv recognizes them.

  * debian/patches/01_broken_perl.dpatch: Apply patch from bz#325148 instead
    of removing the broken perl code.
  * debian/patches/01_no_chromelist.dpatch: Also correctly call make-jars.pl
    to avoid creation of unexpected chrome in dist/bin instead of
    dist/bin/chrome.
  * debian/mozconfig:
    + Disable elf-dynstr-gc, which is pretty useless nowadays.
    + Enable javaxpcom support.
  * debian/rules:
    + Added a check between dist/bin and $DESTDIR/usr/lib/xulrunner to see if

    + Work around bug #361806 by setting JAVAC at build time.
    + Work around bug #365934 by using --with-java-include-path configure
      option, and work around a feature of cpp by creating a symlink to the
      real location of jni.h in the debian directory.
    + Don't install dependentlibs.list (see debian/patches/01_xpcomstub.dpatch
      below).
    + Changed the way we move libraries to /usr/lib.
    + Changed the User-Agent string again, it seems too many dumb scripts use
      the useless date from the product string.
  * debian/control: Added java-gcj-compat-dev to build dependencies.

    + Apply patch from bz#327654 to be able to actually build the javaxpcom

    + Don't install GenerateJavaInterfaces.
    + Correctly install javaxpcom.jar.
    + Don't use visibility flags so that symbols are exported.

  * debian/patches/01_icons.dpatch: Apply patch from  bz#314927 to install
    default.xpm in the right place
  * debian/xulrunner.install: Install chrome/icons, where default.xpm is
    sitting.
  * debian/patches/01_installer.dpatch: Apply patch from bz#328505 to allow
    to install without a vendor name.
  * debian/patches/01_mouse_buttons.dpatch: Extended mouse buttons support
    taken from #244305. Thanks Peter Colberg.
  * debian/patches/01_xpcomstub.dpatch: Correctly install dependentlibs.list
    and apply patch from bz#332262 for it to contain NSS libraries.
  * debian/patches/01_distclean.dpatch: Make distclean cleaner.
  * debian/patches/01_target_xpcom_abi.dpatch: Apply patch from bz#322450 plus
    the OS_TEST fix that got landed at the same time so that TARGET_XPCOM_ABI
    is correctly set on sparc.
  * debian/patches/01_embed_initial_visibility.dpatch: Apply patch from
    bz#312998 to fix gtkmozembed's EmbedWindow::GetVisibility. Closes: #365868.

  * debian/rules, debian/libxul-dev.install: Install the SDK files.
  * debian/libxul0d.install: Install MozillaInterfaces.jar in
    /usr/lib/xulrunner instead of inside the SDK (but put a symlink there),
    since it is useful to embed javaxpcom.
  * debian/libxul0d.install, debian/xulrunner.install: Move the PSM files
    from xulrunner to libxul0d. Closes: #359220, #359226.
  * debian/control: Make libxul0d conflict with those older versions of
    xulrunner that included the PSM files.

xulrunner (1.8.0.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libxul0d.install:
    + Install xpt files one by one instead of glob, so that we:
      - put mozgnome.xpt in xulrunner-gnome-support
        (debian/xulrunner-gnome-support.install)
      - don't install the sample simple.xpt
    + Don't install the sample component libsimpletest.so.
  * debian/rules:
    + Don't remove the .chk file, since we don't install it anymore.
    + Use -Wl,--as-needed as LDFLAGS. That will work around upstream linking
      strategy to limit useless linkage.
    + Use a specific LD_LIBRARY_PATH at link time so that we don't need to
      link against indirect dependencies. This is a temporary workaround until
      this is workaround some better other way.
    + Added some install checks after binary packages build, so that we can
      know if we forgot anything.
    + Fixed the way we get the DEBIAN_VERSION.
  * debian/patches/01_native_uconv.dpatch:
    + Don't build intl/uconv/ucvja and friends, since this is supported by
      the native uconv implementation and not even linked into something we
      ship.
    + Properly load invalid UTF-8 files and more generally malformed files
      as to their (supposed) encoding. Closes: #358815, #359049, #358599.
  * debian/patches/01_prefs.dpatch: set javascript.options.showInConsole.
  * debian/patches/01_security_build.dpatch:
    + Don't build the stuff we don't need, and dynamically link libnssckbi to
      both libplc4 and libplds4 instead of linking statically.
    + Build with debugging symbols.
  * debian/patches/01_no_chromelist.dpatch: Don't build chromelist.txt files.
  * debian/patches/01_no_sys_profile.dpatch: Don't install system profile.
  * debian/patches/01_no_examples.dpatch: Don't build the examples.
  * debian/patches/01_xpcomglue.dpatch:
    + Build the xpcom glue as a shared library.
    + Load DSOs from . when directory is not given. That makes regxpcom work
      as "expected".
  * debian/patches/80_xpidl.dpatch: Added an error message when no file is
    given, to sync with the patch against trunk I sent upstream.
  * debian/patches/01_about:plugins.dpatch: Install the files for
    about:plugins. Closes: #354037, #356082.
  * debian/patches/01_installer.dpatch: Install applications in /usr/local/lib
    instead of /usr/lib.
  * debian/patches/00list: Updated accordingly.
  * debian/patches/99_configure.dpatch: Updated.
  * debian/rules, debian/spidermonkey-bin.install: Move out some files from
    the install target instead of the binary target. Install them with
    dh_install.
  * debian/control: Bumped to Standards-Version: 3.6.2.2. No changes required.
  * debian/libxul0d.postinst, debian/libxul0d.preinst: Instead of removing
    compreg.dat and xpti.dat to solve #357589, create a .autoreg file. That
    will trigger components registration in all cases, even in cases where the
    component registry was stored in a profile directory.
    Do it on postinst at configure time instead of preinst.
  * debian/xulrunner-gnome-support.{postinst|prerm}: Also do it when
    configuring or removing xulrunner-gnome-support.
  * debian/libxul0d.prerm: Remove all files that could be generated by running
    xulrunner or programs using libxul as root, plus the .autoreg file we
    create in case it's still there.
  * debian/libxul0d.install, debian/libxul-dev.install: Install the
    libxpcomglue files.
  * debian/control, debian/rules: Added debugging symbols in separated
    packages.
  * debian/control, debian/compat: Bumped debhelper compatibility to 5.
  * debian/libxul0d.links: Add links to the libraries in /usr/lib/xulrunner.
    That will allow some (but not all, because of C++ ABI differences)
    components from mozilla and/or upstream to work with xulrunner. It also
    allows the XPCOM Glue to kinda work without deep modifications.
  * debian/libxul0d.conf, debian/xulrunner.conf, debian/libxul0d.install,
    debian/xulrunner.install, debian/rules: Install GRE "configurations" into
    /etc/gre.d. That is used by the XPCOM Glue (thus, by the xulrunner stub).
  * debian/rules, debian/libxul0d.install: Install the dependentlibs.list file.

xulrunner (1.8.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    + Added a conflict against mozilla-browser on libxul-dev. Closes: #353600.
    + Renamed libsmjs1-dev to libsmjs-dev, since that what is the name of the
      dev package provided by the old spidermonkey package.
    + Sync sections with override for spidermonkey-bin, libsmjs1 and
      libsmjs-dev.
  * debian/libsmjs1-dev.links: Renamed to libsmjs-dev.links.
  * debian/patches/90_xpcom_hppa.dpatch: Somehow, the assembler files got
    their content twice. Fixing that should make it build properly on HPPA.
  * debian/xulrunner.*, debian/libxul0d.*:
    + Moved /usr/share/xulrunner/defaults from xulrunner to libxul0d ; leave
      out profile and preferences. They will be reintroduced if they appear to
      be really useful. As for now, they just seem to be vestiges of Mozilla,
      Firefox or Thunderbird.
    + Moved /usr/share/xulrunner/res from xulrunner to libxul0d.
    + Moved /usr/share/xulrunner/chrome/classic.*, en-US.* and toolkit.* from
      xulrunner to libxul0d. If the other chrome files appear to be required
      for something else, we might consider moving them as well.
  * debian/control: Add a conflict on older xulrunner to libxul0d according to
    the moving around of files.
  * debian/rules: Changed the way we identificate ourselves in
    /usr/share/xulrunner/defaults/pref/vendor.js, and move it in libxul0d.
    We will using be Gecko/Debian/<debian_release> instead of Gecko/yyyymmdd,
    which was pointless anyway, because it was giving the date of the build,
    not the date of the API...
  * debian/patches/01_prefs.dpatch: Fix some printer and font configuration.
  * debian/patches/00list: Updated accordingly.

xulrunner (1.8.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    + copy LICENSE instead of creating a link.
    + add -A to dh_installdocs.
    + don't install README.txt.
    + don't change xulrunner-gtkmozembed.pc, xulrunner-plugin.pc
      and xulrunner-xpcom.pc. Some applications that build against gecko
      seem to make bad assumptions, at least with gtkmozembed. It is safest
      this way, until things change upstream.
  * debian/patches/01_sonames.dpatch: Fix the dirname complain.
  * debian/xulrunner.install, debian/xulrunner.links, debian/libxul0d.install,
    debian/libxul0d.links: Moved greprefs from xulrunner to libxul0d.
    The usually necessary changes to dependencies and conflicts have not been
    made because 1.8.0.1-1 never reached the archive.
  * debian/patches/90_js_mipsel_endianness.dpatch: Patch to fix little
    endianness of mipsel. Thanks Ian Jackson and Thiemo Seufer.
  * debian/patches/80_passwdmgr.dpatch: Take patch from bz#235336 as suggested
    by Ian Jackson to allow password manager to work with sites that only have
    a password field, no username.
  * debian/patches/01_gfx_cairo.dpatch, debian/patches/01_gfx_thebes.dpatch,
    debian/patches/01_canvas_cairo.dpatch: Removed. They were for the 1.9
    branch.
  * debian/patches/00list: Updated accordingly.
