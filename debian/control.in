Description: XUL + XPCOM application runner
 XULRunner is a single "gecko runtime" that can be used to bootstrap
 multiple XUL + XPCOM applications that are as rich as Firefox and
 Thunderbird.
 .
 XUL is Mozilla's XML based User Interface language that lets you build
 feature-rich cross platform applications. These applications are easily
 customized with alternative text, graphics and layout so that they can be
 readily branded or localized for various markets. Web developers already
 familiar with Dynamic HTML (DHTML) will learn XUL quickly and can start
 building applications right away.
 .
 XPCOM is a cross platform component model. It has multiple language
 bindings and IDL descriptions so programmers can plug their custom
 functionality into the framework and connect it with other components.
 .
 This package also contains the Gecko engine library (libxul)

Description: standalone JavaScript/ECMAScript (ECMA-262) interpreter
 SpiderMonkey is a standalone JavaScript/ECMAScript interpreter. It can either
 take input from files or from a command line driven interface.
 .
 ECMAScript (ECMA-262) is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype
 based object construction. The basic syntax is intentionally similar to
 both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn
 the language. Language constructs, such as if statements, for and while
 loops, and switch and try ... catch blocks function the same as these
 languages (or nearly so).
 .
 JavaScript is a superset of the ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ECMAScript) standard
 first introduced by Netscape and now led by the Mozilla project.

Description: Development files for the Gecko engine library
 This library provides an  API for XUL applications and Gecko embedders.
 The Gecko engine is the core of the mozilla.org applications such as
 Firefox, Thunderbird or SeaMonkey.
 .
 Gecko features include XPCOM, networking, DOM editing and transaction
 support, XBL, XUL, SVG, XSLT, XML Extras (XMLHttpRequest and DOMParser),
 Web Services (SOAP), accessibility support, IPC services, gtkmozembed, etc.
 .
 Install this package if you wish to embed the Gecko engine in your
 program or want to develop XPCOM components.
 .
 This package also provides the Xulrunner Software Development Kit in the
 same form as the one you may find on mozilla.org in /usr/lib/xulrunner/sdk.

Description: XPCOM bindings for Java
 JavaXPCOM allows for communication between Java and XPCOM, such that a
 Java application can access XPCOM objects, and XPCOM can access any Java
 class that implements an XPCOM interface.
 With JavaXPCOM, a developer can talk to XPCOM or embed Gecko from a Java
 application. JavaXPCOM is very similar to XPConnect (JavaScript-XPCOM
 bridge), and uses XPIDL
 .
 Install this package if you wish to access XPCOM objects from Java or
 the other way around.
 .
 This package also provides the JavaXPCOM interfaces sources.
